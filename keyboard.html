In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Window's Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine. A command-line interface is a type of user interface operated entirely through a keyboard, or another device doing the job of one.</p>

                                     A backlit keyboard is a keyboard where the keys are illuminated for viewing in dim or completely dark conditions. Backlighting is a common feature among the PC gamer market of keyboards due to their practicality in low light environments and for aesthetics. Traditional LEDs are monochromatic and have two legs: positive and negative. Keyboard switches designed to accept LEDs typically only provide space for a standard LED with two legs, so full-colour illumination is not possible. As stated above, Cherry themselves resolved this issue by providing support for external LEDs. Since the Cherry MX shell theoretically has space for a full RGB LED, clone manufacturers typically utilise all four base holes (two for the LED, and two for the jumper or diode) to accommodate the four legs of an RGB LED. The LED recess shape is amended to support such an LED, and RGB switches can be distinguished from monochrome LED switches by the shape of the LED recess.

                                     A wireless keyboard is a computer keyboard that allows the user to communicate with computers, tablets, or laptops with the help of radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR) or Bluetooth technology. It is common for wireless keyboards available these days to be accompanied by a wireless mouse. Wireless keyboards based on infrared technology use light waves to transmit signals to other infrared-enabled devices. But, in case of radio frequency technology, a wireless keyboard communicates using signals which range from 27 MHz to up to 2.4 GHz. Most wireless keyboards today work on 2.4 GHz radio frequency. Bluetooth is another technology that is being widely used by wireless keyboards. These devices connect and communicate to their parent device via the bluetooth protocol. A wireless keyboard can be connected using RF technology with the help of two parts, a transmitter and a receiver. The radio transmitter is inside the wireless keyboard. The radio receiver plugs into a keyboard port or USB port. Once the receiver and transmitter are plugged in, the computer recognizes the keyboard and mouse as if they were connected via a cable.

                                     An ergonomic keyboard is a computer keyboard designed with ergonomic considerations to minimize muscle strain and a host of related problems. Typically such keyboards for two-handed typists are constructed in a V shape, to allow right and left hands to type at a slight angle more natural to the human form. It is claimed that an ergonomic keyboard may reduce muscle strain and reduce risk of carpal tunnel syndrome or other kinds of repetitive strain injury, but one should be aware that many “ergonomic” keyboards change the musculoskeletal region exposed to risk, instead of eliminating hazardous postures. Manufacturers also claim that after a user takes the time to adjust to this style of keyboard, they can increase typing speed. Ergonomic keyboards are above the average price of standard keyboards (due to sophisticated manufacturing). You may need some practice to get used to the new layout and typing experience. These keyboards are mostly beneficial for users with the skill of "blind-typing". Without this skill the average user may not find any true benefit, as it feels more complicated than using a standard keyboard.

                                     A gaming keypad is a small, auxiliary keyboard designed only for gaming. It has a limited number of the original keys from a standard keyboard, and they are arranged in a more ergonomic fashion to facilitate quick and efficient gaming key presses. The commonly used keys for gaming on a computer are the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', and the keys close and adjacent to these keys. These keys and style of using a keyboard is referred to as WASD. A gaming keypad will not only optimize the WASD layout, but will often contain extra functionality, such as volume control, the Esc. key, and the F1–F12 keys. The genres of PC games that have been influenced and affected by the development of gaming keypads are first-person shooters (FPS), third-person action-adventure, and massively multiplayer online games (MMO). In each of these styles of games, there is control over the movement of one character, and this traditionally is done by the WASD keys.

                                     A mechanical keyboard is a term usually used to categorize keyboards with high quality key switches. The term is sometimes defined as a keyboard that uses a switching mechanism which makes use of some sort of metal spring, or a switch that actuates at some point before the end of the switch's travel. Traditionally, the term 'mechanical keyboard' referred to the typewriter-based keyboards that were common on computer consoles in the 1950s and 1960s, where the process of determining which key had been pressed was almost entirely electromechanical. In the 1970s, these were replaced with 'electronic' keyboards, which were keyboards that used digital circuitry to determine which keys had been pressed. However, as rubber dome keyboards become ubiquitous in the 1990s, companies began to market their microswitch-based keyboards as having 'mechanical' switches. The difference between mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards lies in the switches beneath the keys. Mechanical keyboards are designed to mimic what typing feels like on a typewriter. Mechanical switches have been known to last much longer than the traditional membrane switches, as well as allowing users to type faster and more effectively, and resulting in less typographical errors.
